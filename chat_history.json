Here's what I changed:\n\n1. **iOS Configuration**: Added an `icon` object with a `padding` property set to \"10%\". This will add 10% padding around the icon, effectively making it appear 10% smaller on iOS devices.\n\n2. **Android Configuration**: The adaptive icon system on Android automatically handles icon sizing, but I've added a `monochromeImage` property to ensure consistency across different Android themes.\n\nThe changes will:\n- Make the icon appear 10% smaller on iOS by adding padding around it\n- Maintain consistency across Android devices with the adaptive icon system\n- Keep the same icon image file but display it with reduced visual size\n\nAfter making these changes, you'll need to rebuild your app for the changes to take effect on the actual app icon that appears on device home screens."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-06T20:48:31Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Use the attached photo for the icon after downloading to the phone.
